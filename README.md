Project of my fourth semester for the subject of WEB Applications. Let's see how it goes.
Also, I'll journal and track the progress down there. Trying to stay organized and consistent.

*What have I done today?*

**04-07**
Been reading and searching about login systems. Dany's video was the most helpful and interesting. Marked the most important concepts into my notebook and feel more or less ready to start with it. Let's decide, that *login-sign-up system* will be the first step towards realisation.

**04-08**
GIT repository was created and this journal has been filled. Finnaly using github on purpose. Planning to play with Python today a bit. Realised I need it in my life and gave myself a promise to take it seriously this time. "Automate the boring stuff..." is a huge helper, just need someone to push me on everyday basis. As to the project, leaving it for the weekend. Just uploaded source files today , which ain't help much.

**04-11**
Basic HTML for log-in and sign-up pages , basic footer and header , database connection , beggining of the functions.

**04-20**
Login system works , finally. Tested and good to go

**04-24**
Car Gallery is almost done

**04-30**
Finished with gallery and image uploading. Did some tweaking and testing , almost done with "rating" feature , moving into the finish phase.
Still some stuff to-do:
- rating form
- test-drive form and binding
- Looooots of styling

**04-04**
Finished with all the functionality , working on style now

**04-05**
4 hours of styling, testing and polishing. As a result:
- adequate responsive style
- a bunch of new cars
- working systems for login, rating and testdrive

Final thoughts soon. Feels good.
