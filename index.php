Things TO DO and to find out:
STYLE STUFF:
-- How to keep multiple pages in one style , with one footer and header. Perhaps
-- how to make LIST of cars with its make in bold font over it

DATABASE STUFF:
-- How to link database and use it
-- How to create a page with a list of products from the database
-- Login and registration system https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCo6JqGMi30
-- How to output images which are assigned to the product in the DATABASE , perhaps?
-- How to use the same sample page for every product in database and just cahnge the parameters and description

-- Rating database is going to be more about style, shouldn't be too hard , to implement

NON-TECH stuff:
-- LIST OF CARS AND specs
-- Images from GT or Forza , maybe even a complete database of them

Steps:
-- Setup database for logins , so they work
-- Setup a basic page with the list of cars , which would be linked to the database
